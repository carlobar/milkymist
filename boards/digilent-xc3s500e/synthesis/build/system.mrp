Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:LIT:176 - Clock buffer is designated to drive clock loads. BUFGMUX
   symbol "physical_group_ddram/dqs_clk_delayed/ddram/b_dqs_p_delayed" (output
   signal=ddram/dqs_clk_delayed) has a mix of clock and non-clock loads. The
   non-clock loads are:
   Pin PSCLK of ddram/clkgen_dqs_delayed
WARNING:LIT:176 - Clock buffer is designated to drive clock loads. BUFGMUX
   symbol "physical_group_sampling/sample_clk/sampling/b_sample" (output
   signal=sampling/sample_clk) has a mix of clock and non-clock loads. The
   non-clock loads are:
   Pin PSCLK of sampling/clkgen_sample
WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator graph/pixel_i/rgb<2>21 failed to merge
   with F5 multiplexer graph/pixel_i/rgb<1>1146_f5.  There is a conflict for the
   FXMUX.  The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.
WARNING:Place:957 - Placer has detected that XIL_PLACE_ALLOW_LOCAL_BUFG_ROUTING
   has been set. This environment variable has been deprecated. An ERROR in
   clock placement rules can be demoted to a WARNING by using the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint on a specific component pin in the .ucf
   file.
WARNING:Place:963 - A DCM / BUFGCTRL clock component pair have been found that
   are not placed at an optimal DCM / BUFGCTRL site pair. The DCM component
   <clkgen_sys> is locked to site <DCM_X0Y1> and the corresponding BUFGCTRL
   component <clk_50Mhz_BUFG> is locked to site <BUFGMUX_X0Y9>. This will not
   allow the usage of the fast path between the DCM and the Clock buffer. This
   is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on
   COMP.PIN <clkgen_sys.CLK0> allowing your design to continue. This constraint
   disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of
   this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing
   results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the
   design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <sys_clk_fb_IBUF> is incomplete. The
   signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:781 - PULLUP on an active net. PULLUP of comp led<7> is
   set but the tri state is not configured.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network sys_clk_fb_IBUF has no load.
INFO:MapLib:564 - The following environment variables are currently set:
INFO:MapLib:591 - XIL_MAP_OLD_SAVE 	Value: :1
INFO:MapLib:159 - Net Timing constraints on signal clk_in are pushed forward
   through input buffer.
INFO:MapLib:159 - Net Timing constraints on signal sys_clk_fb are pushed forward
   through input buffer.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:LIT:66 - BUFGMUX chain detected. Two or more BUFMGUXs are connected in
   series. Because non-standard routing resources must be used to connect the
   BUFGMUXs, this chain can result in: 1) skew between the clocks derived from
   outputs of different stages of this chain, and/or 2) skew between the
   resulting clock and clocks that use other BUFGMUX paths.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   -40.000 to 100.000 Celsius)
INFO:Pack:1720 - Initializing voltage to 1.140 Volts. (default - Range: 1.140 to
   1.320 Volts)
INFO:Pack:1650 - Map created a placed design.
INFO:PhysDesignRules:772 - To achieve optimal frequency synthesis performance
   with the CLKFX and CLKFX180 outputs of the DCM comp clkgen_sys, consult the
   device Interactive Data Sheet.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
 125 block(s) removed
   8 block(s) optimized away
 123 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
