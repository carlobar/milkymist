<msg type="warning" file="ParHelpers" num="79" delta="old" >
The following Clock signals are not routed on the dedicated
global clock routing resources. This will usually result in
longer delays and higher skew for the clock load pins. This could
be the result of incorrect clock placement, more than 8 clocks
feeding logic in a single quadrant of the device, or incorrect
logic partitioning into the quadrant(s). Check the timing report
to verify the delay and skew for this net

<msg type="warning" file="Par" num="468" delta="old" >Your design did not meet timing.  The following are some suggestions to assist you to meet timing in your design.

Review the timing report using Timing Analyzer (In ISE select &quot;Post-Place &amp;
Route Static Timing Report&quot;). Go to the failing constraint(s) and evaluate the failing paths for each constraint.

Try the Design Goal and Strategies for Timing Performance(In ISE select Project -&gt; Design Goals &amp; Strategies) to ensure the best options are set in the tools for timing closure.
