WARNING:LIT:176 - Clock buffer is designated to drive clock loads. BUFGMUX
   symbol "physical_group_sys_clk/b1" (output signal=sys_clk) has a mix of clock
   and non-clock loads. The non-clock loads are:
   Pin PSCLK of ddram/clkgen_dqs
WARNING:LIT:175 - Clock buffer is designated to drive clock loads. BUFGMUX
   symbol "physical_group_sys_clk_n/b2" (output signal=sys_clk_n) has a mix of
   clock and non-clock loads. Some of the non-clock loads are (maximum of 5
   listed):
   Pin I0 of ddram/hpdmc/ddrio/oddr_dqm/oddr1/Mmux_Q11
   Pin I0 of ddram/hpdmc/ddrio/oddr_dqm/oddr0/Mmux_Q11
   Pin I0 of ddram/hpdmc/ddrio/sdram_dq_t<0>1
   Pin I0 of ddram/hpdmc/ddrio/oddr_dq/oddr9/Mmux_Q11
   Pin I0 of ddram/hpdmc/ddrio/oddr_dq/oddr8/Mmux_Q11
WARNING:LIT:178 - Clock buffer BUFGMUX symbol
   "physical_group_ddram/dqs_clk_n/ddram/b2" (output signal=ddram/dqs_clk_n)
   does not drive clock loads. Driving only non-clock loads with a clock buffer
   will cause ALL of the dedicated clock routing resources for this buffer to be
   wasted. The non-clock loads are:
   Pin I0 of ddram/hpdmc/ddrio/sdram_dqs_out<0>1

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:1063 - Invalid configuration (incorrect pin connections
   and/or modes) on
   block:<cpu/cpu/instruction_unit/icache/memories[1].way_0_data_ram/Mram_mem1.A
   >:<RAMB16_RAMB16A>.  The block is configured to use an input parity pins.

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:738 - Unexpected DCM configuration. DCM comp
   ddram/clkgen_dqs has CLKOUT_PHASE_SHIFT set without a connection from CLKO or
   CLK2X to CLKFB. To achieve fine-grained phase shifting (CLKOUT_PHASE_SHIFT =
   FIXED or VARIABLE), CLKFB must be connected to either CLK0 or CLK2X.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:739 - Unexpected DCM feedback loop. The signal
   ddram/dqs_clk on the CLKFB pin of comp ddram/clkgen_dqs is not driven by an
   IOB or BUFGMUX therefore the phase relationship of output clocks to CLKIN
   cannot be guaranteed.

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
