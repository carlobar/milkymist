................
WARNING:Place:957 - Placer has detected that XIL_PLACE_ALLOW_LOCAL_BUFG_ROUTING
   has been set. This environment variable has been deprecated. An ERROR in
   clock placement rules can be demoted to a WARNING by using the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint on a specific component pin in the .ucf
   file.
WARNING:Place:963 - A DCM / BUFGCTRL clock component pair have been found that
   are not placed at an optimal DCM / BUFGCTRL site pair. The DCM component
   <clkgen_sys> is locked to site <DCM_X0Y1> and the corresponding BUFGCTRL
   component <clk_50Mhz_BUFG> is locked to site <BUFGMUX_X0Y9>. This will not
   allow the usage of the fast path between the DCM and the Clock buffer. This
   is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on
   COMP.PIN <clkgen_sys.CLK0> allowing your design to continue. This constraint
   disables all clock placer rules related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of
   this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing
   results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the
   design.
